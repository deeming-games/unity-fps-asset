# Welcome to Unity FPS Asset

This is a free, open-source, community driven FPS asset for Unity. Once finished, it will be released for free in the Unity Asset Store.

My aims for this project are as follows:

* A ready-to-use first-person character controller
* Support for jumping, crouching, sprinting, using ladders
* A weapon system with basic inventory
* Support for damaging enemies and other objects
* System for interacting with objects
* No third-party/non-default package dependencies
* Fully open-source, accepting community additions/fixes
* Licensed to allow use in commercial projects including the included models and sounds
* A strong basis for protyping or developing any FPS game

The asset is in a pretty functional state already. But, it is far from perfect and not all of the features above are included, yet.

Feel free to get stuck in and try it out and either post issues or submit pull requests. I will be fleshing out details of licensing, this readme and other documentation.
